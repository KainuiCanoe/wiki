## 	Pre Sale

## KAI token distribution

10/90 distribution: 10% to the founders (early contributors) and 90% going to content providers who will vote on how 
to distribute it including how much to use for crowd sales. Founders (early contributors) will all have vesting.

## Founder vesting

Vesting is necessary with no exceptions. It ensures that founders are invested for the long term. Our main goal is to 
improve and protect the organization. That's why vesting is a way to show responsibility to all of the contributors.
Founders and early contributors will have 7 years vesting with 3 months cliff. This means we will mature 25% of our tokens each 6 months.

## Funds management

Funds raised in ether will be managed by a legal entity. Details about legal infrastructure and itâ€™s governance will 
be published before the token sale campaign starts. Purpose of the legal entity will be protocol R&D.
